I am an **AI Engineer** with a specialization in **Computer Vision** and **Geospatial Intelligence (GIS)**. My work focuses on building advanced algorithms for **Change Detection**, **Localization**, and **UAV imagery analysis**.

A **GKS Scholar** holding an M.S. in Environmental Science & Engineering from [UNIST](https://www.unist.ac.kr/), I combine deep technical expertise with a **trilingual** (English, Korean, Thai) to solve complex spatial challenges on a global scale.

My research interests are:

- Remote sensing and satellite imagery analysis
- Urban change detection and compliance monitoring
- UAV/drone navigation and localization
- Deep learning for environmental monitoring
