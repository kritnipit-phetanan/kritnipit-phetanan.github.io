I am an **AI Engineer** with a specialization in **Computer Vision** and **Geospatial Intelligence (GIS)**. My technical focus lies in developing innovative algorithms for **Change Detection**, **Localization**, and **UAV imagery analysis**.

A **GKS Scholar** holding an M.S. in Environmental Science & Engineering from [UNIST](https://www.unist.ac.kr/), I am **trilingual** (English, Korean, Thai) and eager to apply my technical skills to drive impactful innovation in international settings.

My research interests include:
- 🛰️ Remote sensing and satellite imagery analysis
- 🤖 Deep learning for environmental monitoring
- 🚁 UAV/drone navigation and localization
- 🏙️ Urban change detection and compliance monitoring
