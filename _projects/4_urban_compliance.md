## Overview

Developed an **end-to-end surveillance system** to identify unauthorized urban structures (e.g., illegal extensions, warehouses) by analyzing geometric changes rather than just visual differences.

### Key Features

- **Geometric Change Detection**: Goes beyond visual analysis to detect structural changes
- **Monocular Depth Estimation**: Generates depth maps from single camera images
- **DEM Integration**: Compares estimated depth with Digital Elevation Models
- **Unauthorized Structure Detection**: Identifies illegal extensions, warehouses, and other violations
- **Urban Compliance**: Supports municipal enforcement and urban planning

### Approach

1. **Depth Estimation**: Generate depth maps from monocular imagery
2. **DEM Comparison**: Compare with reference Digital Elevation Model
3. **Change Detection**: Identify geometric discrepancies
4. **Classification**: Determine potential compliance violations

### Technologies Used

- Deep Learning for Depth Estimation
- Digital Elevation Model (DEM) Processing
- Change Detection Algorithms
- GIS Integration
