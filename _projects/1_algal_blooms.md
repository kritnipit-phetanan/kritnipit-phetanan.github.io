## Research Context

At **UNIST (Sep 2022 - Aug 2024)**, I worked on implementing Computer Vision techniques on Sentinel-1 SAR imagery for precise change detection and localization of algal blooms in Korean reservoirs.

### Technical Approach

- **SAR Image Processing**: Utilized Sentinel-1 C-band SAR data for all-weather monitoring capability
- **Deep Learning Models**: Implemented Faster R-CNN and U-Net architectures for bloom detection and segmentation
- **Multi-temporal Analysis**: Developed algorithms for tracking bloom evolution over time
- **Multi-source Data Fusion**: Combined satellite imagery with in-situ sensor data

---

## Key Results

- **High Detection Accuracy**: Achieved robust bloom detection even under cloud cover conditions
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Enabled continuous surveillance without weather limitations
- **Published Research**: Contributed to paper published in **GIScience & Remote Sensing** (Taylor & Francis)
