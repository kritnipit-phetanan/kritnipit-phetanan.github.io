## Overview

Developed an **AI-driven monitoring system** for detecting harmful algal blooms and trace contaminants in water systems using Sentinel-1 SAR imagery and deep learning models. This research was conducted in collaboration with **K-water (Korea Water Resources Corporation)**, with the primary study area focused on the **Geum River** basin in South Korea.

## Research Context

At **UNIST**, I worked on implementing deep learning techniques on Sentinel-1 SAR imagery for precise change detection and localization of algal blooms & trace contaminants in Korean reservoirs.

### Technical Approach

- **SAR Image Processing**: Utilized Sentinel-1 C-band SAR data for all-weather monitoring capability
- **Deep Learning Models**: Implemented Faster R-CNN for bloom & trace contaminant detection
- **Multi-temporal Analysis**: Developed algorithms for tracking bloom seasonality
- **Multi-source Data Fusion**: Combined satellite imagery with in-situ sensor data

## Key Results

- **High Detection Accuracy**: Achieved bloom detection even under cloud cover conditions with a recall ~0.70
- **Complementary Tool**: Developed a complementary tool for monitoring blooms and the basic development of automatic detection algorithms. 
- **Published Research**: Contributed to paper published in **GIScience & Remote Sensing** (Taylor & Francis)
